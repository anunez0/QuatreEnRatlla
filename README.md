# Quatre en ratlla

The project description is in [this link](https://github.com/jordi-petit/lp-quatre-en-ratlla) (Catalan).

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Open a console and `cd` to the directory where you extracted the source code.

2. Run

    ```bash
    > ghc joc.hs
    ```

    to build the game.

3. This creates an executable file called `joc`. This executable allows you to run the game using the command:

    ```bash
    > ./joc
    ```
